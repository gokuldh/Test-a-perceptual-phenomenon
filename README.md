# Test-a-perceptual-phenomenon

This is a project that utilises inferential statistics to test a set of hypothesis(NULL and ALTERNATIVE) based on two sets of related data, to either accept the null hypothesis or reject the null hypothesis, i.e. accept the alternative.

Here we look at the stroop test with congruent and incongruent words condition, to come up with two hypothesis relating to these conditions. Then we perform a dependent t-test to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
